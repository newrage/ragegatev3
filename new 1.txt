Place your Custom Mod .MPQ within your WoW's Data folder
Path: World of Warcraft\Data\{Here}

WoW will load any Custom MPQ files placed in it's Data folder, as long it is Labeled Correct: "Patch-#.MPQ"
# is a Letter between A-Z, which needs to be in Capital letters.
you can also use the Numbers. but i do not Recommend it. (but if you do use 4-9, single diget)
also keep in mind that the P in Patch and MPQ needs to be in Capital

File Priority:
every file within WoW's file system is Unique, as so are textures
if you want to use another Mod to Replace some content of another it will have a letter more do
Example: Patch-B.MPQ, files will replace files Duplicate files in Patch-A-MPQ. any other files in Patch-A.MPQ will be used.
